# Welcome to the Gw2 compagnon App. 

This is a side project. 
The objective is to display various information relative to your Gw2 account without hopping between characters. 
Guild Wars 2 dev and Arena graciously offers a API system that allows reading only access to various info.

# Usage 
In order to properly use this app, you will need an api key relative to your account from Arenanet. 
Please refer to the wiki on how to generate said key:

+ https://account.arena.net/login?redirect_uri=%2Fapplications

# The project structure
This project is bound to evolve with time.      
As of now, only the inventory of your characters and their names will be displayed.        
This implies that you need tokens with corresponding rights.     

I won't accept any push request until august 2025. 
I am an apprentice web developer, as such I want to show this project for my formation. 
I will however try to read comments, and happily receive feedback for new functions. 

As long as I am credited, feel free to pull or fork the project. 
Remenber git is all knowing.
